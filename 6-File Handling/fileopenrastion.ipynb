    "# üìÇ File Operations in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "File handling is an essential part of many Python programs, allowing you to read from and write to files stored on your system. Python provides a simple and efficient way to work with files using built-in functions and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are File Operations?\n",
    "\n",
    "File operations refer to the actions performed to create, open, read, write, and close files. Files can be text files, binary files, or other types. Python treats files as objects and provides many methods to manipulate them.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key File Operation Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Opening a file:** Use the `open()` function to open a file. It returns a file object.\n",
    "- **Modes:** Files can be opened in various modes like read (`'r'`), write (`'w'`), append (`'a'`), binary (`'b'`), etc.\n",
    "- **Reading a file:** Read content using methods like `.read()`, `.readline()`, or `.readlines()`.\n",
    "- **Writing to a file:** Write content using `.write()` or `.writelines()`.\n",
    "- **Closing a file:** Always close the file after operations using `.close()` or use `with` statement for automatic closing.\n",
    "- **Handling exceptions:** Use `try-except` blocks to handle errors such as file not found or permission issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of File Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation         | Description                                                  |\n",
    "|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Create a file     | Opens a new file for writing (creates if not exists)         |\n",
    "| Read a file       | Opens and reads the content of a file                        |\n",
    "| Write to a file   | Write or overwrite content in a file                         |\n",
    "| Append to a file  | Add content to the end of an existing file                   |\n",
    "| Delete a file     | Remove a file from the filesystem (`os.remove()`)            |\n",
    "| Rename a file     | Rename or move a file using `os.rename()`                    |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Are File Operations Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data storage:** Save and retrieve data persistently.\n",
    "- **Data processing:** Read input files, process data, and write results.\n",
    "- **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks involving files.\n",
    "- **Logging:** Keep logs of program execution for debugging or analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prefer using the `with open() as file:` syntax to ensure proper resource management.\n",
    "- Always specify the file mode explicitly to avoid accidental data loss.\n",
    "- Handle exceptions to create robust file-handling code.\n",
    "- Use modules like `os` and `shutil` for advanced file operations.\n",
