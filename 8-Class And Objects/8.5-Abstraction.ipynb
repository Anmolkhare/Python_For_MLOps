    "# 🎭 Abstraction in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Introduction\n",
    "Abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), along with Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. It is the concept of hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, abstraction lets you focus on **what** an object does instead of **how** it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Why Use Abstraction?\n",
    "- Improves code readability and maintainability\n",
    "- Promotes modularity by separating interface from implementation\n",
    "- Allows implementation changes without affecting external code\n",
    "- Encourages code reuse and scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠 Implementing Abstraction in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python achieves abstraction using:\n",
    "- Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)\n",
    "- The abc module\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Abstract Class\n",
    "An abstract class cannot be instantiated. It may contain one or more abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Abstract Method\n",
    "An abstract method is declared in the abstract class but doesn't have an implementation. Subclasses are required to implement it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Animal(ABC):  # Abstract class\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):  # Abstract method\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Bark\"\n",
    "\n",
    "class Cat(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        return \"Meow\"\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "> 💡 Note: Attempting to instantiate an abstract class directly will result in a TypeError.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use `from abc import ABC, abstractmethod`\n",
    "* Inherit from `ABC` to make a class abstract\n",
    "* Use `@abstractmethod` to define abstract methods\n",
    "* Subclasses must implement all abstract methods, or they will also be abstract\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a **remote control**: You use buttons like `Volume Up` and `Power`, but you don't know the complex circuitry behind them. That’s abstraction — using functionality without knowing the underlying complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ When to Use Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "* When creating a blueprint for a family of classes\n",
    "* When defining common interfaces that must be implemented\n",
    "* When working in teams to define interfaces and expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "1. ❓ What is abstraction in Python? How is it different from encapsulation?\n",
    "   - 📝 Hint: Think about \"what vs. how\" and hiding complexity.\n",

    "### 🧱 Coding Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 🧑‍💻 Create an abstract class Vehicle with an abstract method `start_engine()`. Then create two subclasses (Car and Truck) that implement the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. 🧑‍💻 Write a program that uses abstraction to represent different types of employees. The abstract class should be `Employee`, with a method `calculate_salary()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. 🧑‍💻 Create an abstract class Shape with a method `area()` and implement it for subclasses: `Circle` and `Rectangle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. 🧑‍💻 Demonstrate what happens when you try to instantiate an abstract class directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. 🧑‍💻 Define an abstract class Animal with an abstract method `make_sound()`. Create subclasses `Dog`, `Cat`, and `Bird`, each with its own implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Conceptual Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "8. ❓ Can an abstract class have implemented (concrete) methods in Python?\n",
    "   - 📝 Hint: Think partially implemented interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. ❓ Can a class be abstract without any abstract methods?\n",
    "   - 📝 Hint: Think about restricting instantiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. ❓ What happens if a subclass does not implement all abstract methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Advanced Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "11. 🚀 Create an abstract class called `DatabaseConnection` with methods `connect()`, `disconnect()`, and `query()`. Implement it for classes `MySQLDatabase` and `MongoDatabase`.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. 🧩 Create a system where you define a payment interface using abstraction, and then create classes like `CreditCardPayment`, `PayPalPayment`, etc., that follow the same abstract methods.\n",
