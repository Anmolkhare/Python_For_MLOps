    "# üß¨ Inheritance in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is one of the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows a class (called a child or derived class) to inherit the attributes and methods of another class (called a parent or base class). This promotes code reusability and logical hierarchy.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç Why Use Inheritance?\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ To reuse existing code.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ To establish a relationship between parent and child classes.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ To implement polymorphism.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ To keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n",

    "class Parent:\n",
    "    # parent class members\n",
    "\n",

    "| Multilevel Inheritance   | A child inherits from a parent, which inherits from another parent. |\n",
    "| Hierarchical Inheritance | Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.          |\n",
