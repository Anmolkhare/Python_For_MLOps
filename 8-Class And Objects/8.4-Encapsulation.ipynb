    "## 🧩 What is Encapsulation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and methods (functions) together as a single unit. It restricts direct access to some components of an object and can prevent accidental modification of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Features:\n",
    "- Binds data and functions together.\n",
    "- Controls access using access specifiers.\n",
    "- Promotes modular and maintainable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 Access Modifiers in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Modifier        | Syntax Example      | Access Level               |\n",
    "|----------------|---------------------|----------------------------|\n",
    "| Public          | `self.name`         | Accessible everywhere      |\n",
    "| Protected       | `self._name`        | Accessible in class & subclass |\n",
    "| Private         | `self.__name`       | Accessible only inside class (Name mangling used) |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧪 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Student:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, marks):\n",
    "        self.name = name        # public\n",
    "        self._marks = marks     # protected\n",
    "        self.__grade = 'A'      # private\n",
    "\n",
    "    def display(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Name: {self.name}, Marks: {self._marks}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "s = Student(\"Anmol\", 95)\n",
    "print(s.name)       # ✅\n",
    "print(s._marks)     # ⚠️ Not recommended\n",
    "# print(s.__grade)  ❌ Will raise an error\n",

    "## 🧠 What is Abstraction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and only showing the functionality. It lets you focus on what an object does instead of how it does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplifies complexity\n",
    "* Hides background details\n",
    "* Achieved using abstract classes and interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📦 Abstract Class in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the abc module to define abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔖 Syntax Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "class Vehicle(ABC):\n",
    "    @abstractmethod\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def start_engine(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Car engine started\")\n",
    "\n",
    "c = Car()\n",
    "c.start_engine()\n",

    "| Real World Example | Medicine in a capsule       | ATM machine (hides inner working) |\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Real Life Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🔐 Encapsulation: Just like medicine is encapsulated inside a capsule, data is encapsulated in a class.\n",
    "* 🎭 Abstraction: Like using an ATM – you don’t see how it works, you only interact with the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation protects the data, abstraction hides the complexity.\n",
    "* Both are key principles of Object-Oriented Programming.\n",
    "* They promote code modularity, maintainability, and security.\n",
